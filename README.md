# Progressive-Web-App
Progressive Web Apps combines the best of the web and the best of apps. They are useful to users from the very first visit
in a browser tab, no install required. As the user progressively builds a relationship with the app over time, it becomes 
more and more powerful. It loads quickly, even on flaky networks, sends relevant push notifications, has an icon on the home
screen, and loads as a top-level, full screen experience.

# So Pregressive web app
1. is pregressive </br>
2. works offline </br>
3. feels native app like </br>
4. connectivity independent </br>

# How it works?
The most important component in pregressive web app is app shell. What app shell does is that it separates UI and data content.
So everytime it caches UI in the phone and loads data in the UI asynchronously. Therefore it renders quickly and therefore users 
fell it like an native app.
